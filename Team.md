**The Ekipa Fanihy Association** is the independent organization supporting the field biology team of the Brook Lab of UChicago. The Brook Lab includes students and postdocs based in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago, in addition to suite of inspiring Malagasy graduate students and postdocs at the University of Antananarivo. Collectively with our wonderful in-country administration, we are Ekipa Fanihy, Malagasy for ‘Team Fruit Bat.’

Dr. **RANAIVOSON Christian Hafaliana** is the **Director** of Ekipa Fainhy. He is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. He will lead NGS efforts targeting viral discovery in Malagasy fruit bats. He most recently worked as a Research Engineer in the Virology Unit at Institut Pasteur de Madagascar. At IPM, Christian led Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) studies focused on SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Madagascar. Christian received his Masters and PhD degrees from the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar where his research focused on the distribution and transmission of intra-erythrocytic parasites of Malagasy fruit bats, specifically *Babesia* spp. infections of the Madagascar flying fox, *Pteropus rufus*. Christian has also previously studied infections of Malagasy crayfishes and nematode parasites of Malagasy reptiles. He co-founded Ekipa Fainhy with Dr. Cara Brook when they started conducting field work together in 2013.

Dr. **BROOK Cara** is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Ecology and Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago and the **Scientific Advisor** to Ekipa Fanihy. She investigates the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of zoonotic infections, in particular those derived from wild bat hosts. She is committed to conducting rigorous science while simultaneously promoting scientific development, education, and capacity building in Madagascar. Cara recieved her PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University in 2017 and her BS in Earth Systems from Stanford University in 2010. You can read more about Cara's work and her lab at UChicago on the [Brook Lab website](https://www.brooklab.org). She co-founded Ekipa Fainhy with Dr. Christian Ranaivoson in 2013.

**ANDRY Santino** recently finished his Master's degree in the Department of Entomology at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar, where he worked with the Madagascar Biodiversity Center to document the effects of logging intensification on exotic and native ant assemblages in the new protected area of Ambohidray, District of Moramanga, Madagascar. Santino joined Ekipa Fanihy in August 2019 and will be enrolling as a PhD student with the team in 2023.

**BAKSH Nuzha** is a **Field Project Manager** with Ekipa Fanihy. She co-leads monthly field expeditions to capture and sample fruit bats endemic to Madagascar (<i>Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum, and Rousettus madagascariensis</i>). She has also previously conducted fieldwork sampling endangered mountain yellow-legged frogs in the Sierra Nevadas and various frog species in East Bay California. Nuzha holds a B.S. in Zoology and a Minor in Linguistics from UC Santa Barbara, where she studied the effects of chytrid fungus (*Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis*) on amphibian populations and worked as lab technician to care for a colony of Pacific tree frogs for the Briggs lab.
