Ekipa Fanihy (Team)

**The Ekipa Fanihy Association** is the independent organization supporting the field biology team of the Brook Lab of UChicago. The Brook Lab includes students and postdocs based in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago, in addition to suite of inspiring Malagasy graduate students and postdocs at the University of Antananarivo. Collectively with our wonderful in-country administration, we are Ekipa Fanihy, Malagasy for ‘Team Fruit Bat.’

	<strong><a href="https://brooklab.org/">Cara Brook</a></strong> is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. She received her B.S. in Earth Systems from Stanford University in 2010, and her M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University in 2014 and 2017, respectively, in the lab of Professor Andy Dobson. While at Princeton, Brook pioneered a longterm fruit bat field system in Madagascar, which she maintains to this day. From 2017-2020, she was Miller Postdoctoral Fellow in the lab of Professor Mike Boots at the University of California, Berkeley, and in 2020, she was awarded a Loréal USA For Women in Science fellowship and a Branco Weiss Society in Science fellowship, which she began at Berkeley and transitioned to her current faculty job at U-Chicago.

	<strong>Dr. Christian Ranaivoson</a></strong> Dr. Christian Ranaivoson is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. He will lead NGS efforts targeting viral discovery in Malagasy fruit bats. He has a PhD in the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar and recently worked as a Research Engineer in the Virology Unit at Institut Pasteur de Madagascar. Christian’s PhD research focused on the distribution and transmission of intra-erythrocytic parasites of Malagasy fruit bats, specifically Babesia spp. infections of the Madagascar flying fox, Pteropus rufus. At IPM, Christian led Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) studies focused on SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Madagascar. Christian holds a Master’s degree in Biology, Ecology, and Animal Conservation from the University of Antananarivo and has previously studied infections of Malagasy crayfishes and nematode parasites of Malagasy reptiles.
