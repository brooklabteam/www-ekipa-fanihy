**The Ekipa Fanihy Association** is the independent organization supporting the field biology team of the Brook Lab of UChicago. The Brook Lab includes students and postdocs based in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago, in addition to suite of inspiring Malagasy graduate students and postdocs at the University of Antananarivo. Collectively with our wonderful in-country administration, we are Ekipa Fanihy, Malagasy for ‘Team Fruit Bat.’

  Dr. Christian Ranaivoson is the Director of Ekipa Fainhy. He is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. He will lead NGS efforts targeting viral discovery in Malagasy fruit bats. He has a PhD in the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar and recently worked as a Research Engineer in the Virology Unit at Institut Pasteur de Madagascar. Christian’s PhD research focused on the distribution and transmission of intra-erythrocytic parasites of Malagasy fruit bats, specifically Babesia spp. infections of the Madagascar flying fox, Pteropus rufus. At IPM, Christian led Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) studies focused on SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Madagascar. Christian holds a Master’s degree in Biology, Ecology, and Animal Conservation from the University of Antananarivo and has previously studied infections of Malagasy crayfishes and nematode parasites of Malagasy reptiles. He co-founded Ekipa Fainhy with Dr. Cara Brook when they started conducting field work together in 2010. (Fact check!)

Angelo Andrianiaina is a PhD student in the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar, where he studies seasonal variation in ectoparasite infestation of two Malagasy fruit bats (*Eidolon dupreanum* and *Rousettus madagascariensis*) and the impacts of this variation on the dynamics of infection for vector-borne pathogens, such as *Bartonella* spp. Angelo holds a Master's degree in Animal Conservation from the University of Antananarivo and has previously worked on projects promoting lemur conservation in vanilla plantations in northern Madagascar, as well as projects documenting small mammal and herpetological biodiversity in the Moramanga District of east-central Madagascar.

Santino Andry recently finished his Master's degree in the Department of Entomology at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar, where he worked with the Madagascar Biodiversity Center to document the effects of logging intensification on exotic and native ant assemblages in the new protected area of Ambohidray, District of Moramanga, Madagascar. Santino joined Ekipa Fanihy in August 2019 and will be enrolling as a PhD student with the team in 2021.

Nuzha Baksh is a Field Project Manager with Ekipa Fanihy. She co-leads monthly field expeditions to capture and sample fruit bats endemic to Madagascar (<i>Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum, and Rousettus madagascariensis</i>). She has also previously conducted fieldwork sampling endangered mountain yellow-legged frogs in the Sierra Nevadas and various frog species in East Bay California. Nuzha holds a B.S. in Zoology and a Minor in Linguistics from UC Santa Barbara, where she studied the effects of chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) on amphibian populations and worked as lab technician to care for a colony of Pacific tree frogs for the Briggs lab.
