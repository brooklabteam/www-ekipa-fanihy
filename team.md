## New Members

<img src="/assets/team/Hands together.JPG" alt="hands" class="img float-end col-sm-3">

We are constantly on the lookout for new members to fill a variety of roles on our team. 

In particular, we regularly support the training of new members in the following roles:
- Master's students 
- PhD students 
- Laboratory or field technicians 
- Foreign volunteers (recruited twice annually via the [Brook Lab](https://brooklab.org/join) at UChicago).

With the exception of foreign volunteers, positions will be posted here as they become available. In the meantime, if you are interested in any of these roles, please reach out to our team's general contact at [team@ekipafanihy.org](mailto:team@ekipafanihy.org). 


#### Master's Program

Association Ekipa Fanihy recruits and trains one new Master's student per year from the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity at the University of Antananarivo. These positions are full time jobs, negotiated for one year contracts. Master's students are expected to design a study, collect data with our field team, and analyze the resulting data for their theses. All Master's students will be responsible for identifying an academic adviser at the University of Antananarivo, officially enrolling in the Master's program at the University of Antananarivo, and fulfilling all requirements of the degree at the university level. Proficiency in English and/or French are desired from Master's students but are not required. Students recruited for these roles can expect to spend roughly 3-5 months in the field, 3-4 months in the lab, and 3-4 months writing their theses to meet the university regulations.

Dr. **RANAIVOSON Hafaliana Christian** is the Director of Association Ekipa Fanihy. Contact: [christian.ranaivoson@ekipafanihy.org](mailto:christian.ranaivoson@ekipafanihy.org).

Currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Brook lab in Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago, Christian leads Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) studies targeting viral discovery in Malagasy fruit bats. Previously, he worked as a Research Engineer in the Virology Unit at Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, where he conducted SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Madagascar. Christian received his Masters and PhD degrees from the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar where his research focused on the distribution and transmission of intra-erythrocytic parasites of Malagasy fruit bats, specifically *Babesia* spp. infections of the Madagascar flying fox, *Pteropus rufus*. Dr. Ranaivoson has also previously studied infections of Malagasy crayfishes and nematode parasites of Malagasy reptiles.
