<h2>New Members</h2>


If you are interested in joining Association Ekipa Fanihy, please email our team's general contact at <team@ekipafanihy.org>. 

We are constantly on the lookout for new members to fill a variety of roles on our team. In particular, we support the training of **one new Master's student each year** from the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity at the University of Antananarivo. Periodically, we additionally employ **qualified PhD students** on our projects, and more rarely, we hire laboratory or field technicians, as well as administrators. Finally, we support 2-4 foreign volunteers on our team each year (for details of these foreign volunteer positions, please visit the [Brook Lab website](https://brooklab.org/join)).


In the case of our Master's program--a full time job, negotiated for a one year contract--students are expected to design a study, collect data with our field team, and analyze the resulting data for publication. All Master's students will be responsible for identifying an academic adviser at the University of Antananarivo, enrolling in the Master's program in the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity, and fulfilling all requirements of the degree at the university level. Proficiency in English and/or French are desired from Master's students but not required. Students recruited for these roles can expect to spend roughly 3-5 months in the field, 3-4 months in the lab, and 3-4 months writing their theses to meet the university regulations.

Dr. **RANAIVOSON Hafaliana Christian** is the Director of Association Ekipa Fanihy. Contact: [christian.ranaivoson@ekipafanihy.org](christian.ranaivoson@ekipafanihy.org).

Currently a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Brook lab in Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago, Christian leads Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) studies targeting viral discovery in Malagasy fruit bats. Previously, he worked as a Research Engineer in the Virology Unit at Institut Pasteur de Madagascar, where he conducted SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Madagascar. Christian received his Masters and PhD degrees from the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar where his research focused on the distribution and transmission of intra-erythrocytic parasites of Malagasy fruit bats, specifically *Babesia* spp. infections of the Madagascar flying fox, *Pteropus rufus*. Dr. Ranaivoson has also previously studied infections of Malagasy crayfishes and nematode parasites of Malagasy reptiles.

**ANDRIANIAINA Angelo** is a Research Technician at Association Ekipa Fanihy. Contact: [angelo.andrianiaina@ekipafanihy.org](angelo.andrianiaina@ekipafanihy.org).

Angelo is a PhD student in the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar. Angelo's dissertation is focused on understanding seasonal variation in ectoparasite infestation of two Malagasy fruit bats (*Eidolon dupreanum* and *Rousettus madagascariensis*) and the impacts of this variation on the dynamics of infection for vector-borne pathogens, such as *Bartonella* spp. Angelo holds a Master's degree in Animal Conservation from the University of Antananarivo and has previously worked on projects promoting lemur conservation in vanilla plantations in northern Madagascar, as well as projects documenting small mammal and herpetological biodiversity in the Moramanga District of east-central Madagascar. He has been a part of the Association Ekipa Fanihy since February 2018.
