Our team is made up of Malagasy biologists including PhD students and Masters students from the University of Antananarivo. Collectively with our wonderful in-country administration and international volunteers we are **Ekipa Fanihy**, Malagasy for ‘Team Fruit Bat.’

Dr. **RANAIVOSON Christian Hafaliana** He is a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at the University of Chicago. He will lead NGS efforts targeting viral discovery in Malagasy fruit bats. He most recently worked as a Research Engineer in the Virology Unit at Institut Pasteur de Madagascar. At IPM, Christian led Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) studies focused on SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance in Madagascar. Dr. Ranaivoson received his Masters and PhD degrees from the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar where his research focused on the distribution and transmission of intra-erythrocytic parasites of Malagasy fruit bats, specifically *Babesia* spp. infections of the Madagascar flying fox, *Pteropus rufus*. Dr. Ranaivoson has also previously studied infections of Malagasy crayfishes and nematode parasites of Malagasy reptiles. He and Dr. Cara Brook started conducting field work together in 2013, which would eventually grow into the Ekipa Fanihy today

**ANDRIANIAINA Angelo** is a PhD student in the Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar. He currently working as a research technician on the bat research project in collaboration with the Brook Lab. He is studing seasonal variation in ectoparasite infestation of two Malagasy fruit bats (*Eidolon dupreanum* and *Rousettus madagascariensis*) and the impacts of this variation on the dynamics of infection for vector-borne pathogens, such as *Bartonella* spp. Angelo holds a Master's degree in Animal Conservation from the University of Antananarivo and has previously worked on projects promoting lemur conservation in vanilla plantations in northern Madagascar, as well as projects documenting small mammal and herpetological biodiversity in the Moramanga District of east-central Madagascar.

**ANDRY Santino** obtained his Master's degree in the Department of Entomology at the University of Antananarivo, Madagascar, where he worked with the Madagascar Biodiversity Center to document the effects of logging intensification on exotic and native ant assemblages in the new protected area of Ambohidray, District of Moramanga, Madagascar. Santino is currently working as a research technician on the bat research project in collaboration with the Brook Lab. Santino joined Ekipa Fanihy in August 2019 and will be enrolling as a PhD student with the team in 2023.

Dr. **BROOK Cara** is a Scientific Advisor to Ekipa Fanihy. Dr. Brook is an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Ecology and Evolution](https://ecologyandevolution.uchicago.edu/) at the University of Chicago . She investigates the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of zoonotic infections, in particular those derived from wild bat hosts. She is committed to conducting rigorous science while simultaneously promoting scientific development, education, and capacity building in Madagascar. Dr. Brook recieved her PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from Princeton University in 2017 and her BS in Earth Systems from Stanford University in 2010. You can read more about Dr. Brook's work and her lab at UChicago on the [Brook Lab website](https://www.brooklab.org). She and Dr. Christian Ranaivoson started conducting field work together in 2013, which would eventually grow into the Ekipa Fanihy today. She is currently running her research in collaboration with the Ekipa Fanihy Association.

**BAKSH Nuzha** is a volunteer Field Project Manager with Ekipa Fanihy. She co-leads monthly field expeditions to capture and sample fruit bats endemic to Madagascar (<i>Pteropus rufus, Eidolon dupreanum, and Rousettus madagascariensis</i>). She has also previously conducted fieldwork sampling endangered mountain yellow-legged frogs in the Sierra Nevadas and various frog species in East Bay California. Nuzha holds a B.S. in Zoology and a Minor in Linguistics from UC Santa Barbara, where she studied the effects of chytrid fungus (*Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis*) on amphibian populations and worked as lab technician to care for a colony of Pacific tree frogs for the Briggs lab.

**McGUIRE Michael** is a volunteer Field Project Manager with Ekipa Fanihy. He co-leads monthly field expeditions to capture and sample Madagascar endemic fruit bats. Michael holds a B.S. in Wildlife and Fisheries Biology and a minor in Geography from the University of Vermont. He has a diverse work history from environmental education and backcountry canoe & kayak guiding in Northern Wisconsin, fieldwork on a sampling project of snowshoe hares in Colorado, assisting and filming an expedition down the Mississippi River to study microplastics distribution, trail construction with Americorps in and around Olympic National Park, salmon habitat restoration on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, and whale-watch guiding within the Salish Sea. Michael is also an accomplished wildlife and nature photographer having earned scholarships, held galleries for his work, and won several awards.
