The story of the **Ekipa Fanihy** (Malagasy for "Team Fruit Bat") dates back  to 2013 when Dr. Christian Ranaivoson and Dr. Cara Brook began their PhD studies together on disease and population dynamics in 3 endemic Malagasy fruit bats: *Pteropus rufus*, *Rousettus madagascariensis* and *Eidolon dupreanum* in the central-eastern highlands of Madagascar. Since then the group has also studied population dynamics in lemurs and tenrecs, disease dynamics in rodents and COVID-19 dynamics in Madagascar. Dr. Christian Ranavioson went on to found the Ekipa Fanihy Association in 2023. Through the Ekipa today, Malagasy researchers have the opportunity to collect data in the field, analyze those data for their higher education degrees and become leaders in the field of bat ecology and research areas beyond. The Ekipa currently collaborates with the [Brook Lab](https://brooklab.org/) of the University of Chicago, [Madagascar Biodiversity Center](https://www.madagascarbio.org/) and [Madagasikara Voakajy](https://www.madagasikara-voakajy.org/).

<h2>Group mission</h2>

Our mission is to further studies of disease ecology and conservation biology in Madagascar by Malagasy scientists. We run and provide a long-term, sustainable research project for Malagasy biologists to join to complete their degrees and begin long, successful careers in science and conservation. Our work also aims to bring new laboratory technologies to Madagascar to be used in wildlife research and eventually in public health.
