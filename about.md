The story of the **Ekipa Fanihy** (Malagasy for "Team Fruit Bat") dates back  to 2013 when Dr. Christian Ranaivoson and Dr. Cara Brook began their PhD studies together on the disease ecology and conservation biology of the 3 endemic Malagasy fruit bats: *Pteropus rufus*, *Rousettus madagascariensis* and *Eidolon dupreanum* in the central-eastern highlands of Madagascar. Since then the group has also studied population dynamics in lemurs, disease dynmics in rodents and COVID-19 dynamics in Madagascar. Dr. Christian Ranavioson went on to found the **Ekipa Fanihy Association** in 2023. Through the Ekipa today, Malagasy researchers have the opportunity to collect data in the field, analyze those data for their higher education degrees and become leaders in the field of bat ecology and research areas beyond. The Ekipa currently collaborates with the the [Brook Lab](https://brooklab.org/) of the University of Chicago, [Madagascar Biodiversity Center](https://www.madagascarbio.org/) and [Madagasikara Voakajy](https://www.madagasikara-voakajy.org/).
