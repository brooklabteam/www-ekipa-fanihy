The **Ekipa Fanihy Association** was created in 2013 and became an independent association in 2023. Ekipa Fanihy (Malagasy for 'Team Fruit Bat') is an extension of the [Brook Lab]( https://brooklab.org/) of the [University of Chicago](https://uchicago.edu) and was established to provide opportunities for Malagasy researchers and biologists. Through Ekipa, Malagasy researchers have the opportunity to collect data in the field and analyze those data for their higher education degrees and in order to become leaders in the field of bat ecology and in research areas beyond.
