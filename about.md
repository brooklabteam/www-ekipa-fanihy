The story of the **Ekipa Fanihy** (Malagasy for "Team Fruit Bat") dates back  to 2013 when Dr. Christian Ranaivoson and Dr. Cara Brook began their PhD studies together on disease and population dynamics in 3 endemic Malagasy fruit bats: *Pteropus rufus*, *Rousettus madagascariensis* and *Eidolon dupreanum* in the central-eastern highlands of Madagascar. Since then the group has also studied population dynamics in lemurs and tenrecs, disease dynamics in rodents and COVID-19 dynamics in Madagascar. Dr. Christian Ranavioson went on to found the Ekipa Fanihy Association in 2023. Through the Ekipa today, Malagasy researchers have the opportunity to collect data in the field, analyze those data for their higher education degrees and become leaders in the field of bat ecology and research areas beyond. The Ekipa currently collaborates with the [Brook Lab](https://brooklab.org/) of the University of Chicago, [Madagascar Biodiversity Center](https://www.madagascarbio.org/) and [Madagasikara Voakajy](https://www.madagasikara-voakajy.org/).

<h2>Group mission</h2>

The main objective of the association is to create and serve as a platform for disease research and wildlife conservation in Madagascar. We aim to promote research on the identification and census of pathogens in wild animals, train young Malagasy researchers on modern techniques for identifying pathogens and field data collection, and establish a favorable environment and physical infrastructure for the exchange of knowledge between local and foreign researchers.
