<h2>Masters Students</h2>

Ekipa Fanihy welcomes 2 Masters Students per year from the University of Antananarivo Department of Zoology and Animal Biodiversity. Students will design a study, collect data with our field team, and analyze that data for their thesis. This is a full time job, negotiated for a one year contract. The student will be responsible for identifying an adviser at the University of Antananarivo, enrolling in the program, and fulfilling all requirements of the degree at the university level. Proficiency in English and French are encouraged but not required. The student will spend roughly 3-5 months in the field, 3-4 months in the lab, and 3-4 months writing his or her masters thesis. For more information please email Dr. RANAIVOSON Christian at <gammarinema@gmail.com> or <ekipafanihymada@gmail.com>.
