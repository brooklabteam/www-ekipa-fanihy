<h2>Research</h2>

Our research team uses tools derived from field biology, molecular immunology, and epidemiological modeling to study how zoonotic pathogens persist, transmit, and evolve in wild reservoir and spillover human hosts. Much of our work is focused on zoonotic infections derived from bat reservoirs, and we conduct the majority of our field studies in Madagascar. Major areas of research include investigating bats as reservoirs for emerging viral zoonoses, the coevolution of bats and viruses, and bat conservation and population modeling.

<h2>Habitat Protection</h2>

One of Ekipa Fanihyâ€™s goals is to protect the forest in Analambotaka where a large colony of Pteropus rufus roost. This forest and much of the surrounding forest are cut and burned each year for cattle grazing, as is commonly practiced in this area of Madagascar. Ekipa is currently working with the local fokontany and commune to create a VEOY/VOI protected area. We also plan to work with the community to build and improve the bridges and roads leading to and from the Analambotaka area.

<h2>Collaborative Partners in Conservation</h2>

[**Madigasikara Voakajy**](https://www.madagasikara-voakajy.org/): Using age data derived from fruit bat dentition, we have undertaken population modeling studies for wild, Madagascar fruit bats. These studies suggest that the Madagascar Flying Fox, Pteropus rufus, is particularly threatened by habitat destruction and human hunting for food consumption in Madagascar. We are currently working with a local conservation NGO, Madigasikara Voakajy, to develop conservation-oriented intervention plans for this species and undertake new studies aimed at quantifying the positive benefits that this bat offers to healthy ecosystems, including pollination of several endangered Malagasy baobab species. We are also involved in several other conservation collaborations, through which we have undertaken population modeling for several non-Chiropteran threatened taxa, including endemic Malagasy lemurs and tenrecs.
