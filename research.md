<h2>Research</h2>

<img src="/assets/research/lab_tent.jpeg" alt="tent" class="float-end col-md-5" />

Our research focuses on disease ecology and population dynamics. In most of our projects, we are involved at every stage from data collection in the field to data analyzation and publication. Our research team, in close collaboration with the Brook Lab, uses tools derived from field biology, molecular immunology, and epidemiological modeling to study how zoonotic pathogens persist, transmit, and evolve in wild reservoir and spillover human hosts. 

Major areas of research include investigating bats as reservoirs for emerging viral zoonoses, the coevolution of bats and viruses, and bat conservation and population modeling. Our team, including Masters and PhD students from the University of Antananarivo, maintains longterm field sites to study these dynamics in central-eastern Madagascar.

<h2>Habitat Protection</h2>

One of Ekipa Fanihy’s goals is to protect the forest in Analambotaka, one of our field sites, where a large colony of *Pteropus rufus* roost. This area and much of the surrounding forest are cut and burned each year for cattle grazing, as is commonly practiced in Madagascar. Ekipa is currently working with the local fokontany and commune to create a VEOY/VOI protected area. We also plan to work with the community to build and improve the bridges and roads leading to and from the Analambotaka area.

<h2>Collaborative Partners in Conservation</h2>

[**The Brook Lab**](https://brooklab.org/): The Brook Lab of the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) works at the interface of disease ecology and conservation biology to study the dynamics of zoonotic infections–pathogens transmitted from wildlife to human hosts. They conduct the majority of field studies in Madagascar in collaboration with the Ekipa Fanihy Association.

[**Madigasikara Voakajy**](https://www.madagasikara-voakajy.org/): Using age data derived from fruit bat dentition, we have undertaken population modeling studies for wild, Madagascar fruit bats. These studies suggest that the Madagascar Flying Fox, *Pteropus rufus*, is particularly threatened by habitat destruction and human hunting for food consumption in Madagascar. We are currently working with a local conservation NGO, Madigasikara Voakajy, to develop conservation-oriented intervention plans for this species and undertake new studies aimed at quantifying the positive benefits that this bat offers to healthy ecosystems, including pollination of several endangered Malagasy baobab species. We are also involved in several other conservation collaborations, through which we have undertaken population modeling for several non-Chiropteran threatened taxa, including endemic Malagasy lemurs and tenrecs.

**Collaboration with MBC**: An exciting new collaboration coming soon . . .

<h2>Programs</h2>

Together with the Brook Lab and many collaborators, we host 2 courses per year.
